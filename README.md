# reminder-pro
This is my reminder app following [David Katz](http://davidtkatz.com/#/about)'s ReactJS and Redux - Mastering Web Apps Course on Udemy. This repo is used purely for learning exercises and the course content should not be interpreted as something I've created on my own.

The reminder app takes in a reminder and allows the user to set when it is due. The reminders can be cleared as they are completed and all reminders can be cleared if the user wants to do a mass cleaning of their list.
